    <h1 class="aa">Geography of Sri Lanka</h1>
    <br>
    <p> Location and Size: Sri Lanka, formerly known as Ceylon, is strategically positioned southeast of the Indian subcontinent. It’s like a precious gem—often referred to as the “Pearl of the Indian Ocean.” The country covers a total area of approximately 65,610 square kilometers (about 25,330 square miles). Of this, around 64,630 square kilometers (24,950 square miles) are land, while the remaining 980 square kilometers (380 square miles) are water. The coastline stretches for about 1,340 kilometers (830 miles), offering stunning views of the ocean. The main island itself is the twenty-fifth largest in the world by land area, and there are several smaller offshore islands as well1.</p>

    <p>Terrain: Sri Lanka’s terrain is wonderfully diverse. In the south-central interior, you’ll find the mountainous upcountry—a region of rolling hills and lush greenery. The highest point is Pidurutalagala, standing tall at 2,524 meters (8,281 feet). But it’s not all peaks and valleys; there are also vast lowlands, perfect for agriculture. Coconut farms dot the coastal areas, adding to the tropical charm of the landscape .</p>
    <p>Offshore Wonders: Speaking of islands, Sri Lanka boasts numerous offshore gems. One of the most intriguing is Jaffna Island, which was once connected to the Indian mainland by a natural causeway called Adam’s Bridge. According to Hindu mythology, this bridge was built during the rule of Lord Rama. While most of it is now submerged, the limestone shoals that remain still evoke ancient legends and stories .</p>

    <h1 class="aa">Climate of Sri Lanka</h1>
    <br>
    <p>Tropical Monsoons: Sri Lanka’s climate dances to the rhythm of monsoons. There are two main seasons:</p>
    <li>Northeast Monsoon (December to March): During this time, the northeastern part of the island experiences heavy rainfall.</li>
    <li>Southwest Monsoon (June to October): The southwestern regions get their fair share of rain during these months.</li>
    <p> Regional Variations: The climate isn’t uniform across the entire island. Here’s how it breaks down:</p>
    <li>Tropical Wet and Dry Climate (Köppen Aw): About two-thirds of Sri Lanka—especially the northern half and southeastern quarter—falls into this category.</li>
    <li>Tropical Monsoon Climate (Köppen Am): The central highlands, including places like Kandy and Nuwara Eliya, enjoy this monsoonal climate.</li>
    <li>Tropical Rainforest Climate (Köppen Af): The southwestern quarter, with its lush rainforests, experiences abundant rainfall. Some coastal areas even have an oceanic influence (Köppen Cfb)3.</li>

    <p> Average Temperature: The island’s average temperature hovers around 27 degrees Celsius (81 degrees Fahrenheit). However, remember that altitude plays a role—the cooler highlands provide a refreshing escape from the tropical heat.

        In summary, Sri Lanka’s geography and climate weave a rich tapestry of mountains, plains, and coastal wonders. Whether you’re exploring ancient temples, sipping tea in the misty hills, or lounging on palm-fringed beaches, this island paradise has something for everyone.  </p>
